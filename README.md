## Motivation
Main motivation behind this project is to gain knowledge about making an end-to-end machine learning application, which include following things: -
1. Building a Machine Learning model which can predict result with maximum possible accuracy.
2. Building a Backend and Frontend for the Application.
3. Deploying it on Heroku.


## Tools and Technologies Utilized
1.	Python (programming language)
2.	Flask (Web Framework for Python)
3.	HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap (Frontend Part)
4.	Modules Used: - Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pickle, FlaskForm


## Lesson Learned
1.	End-to-end ML Application is far more than Just a ML model in Jupyter Notebook.
2.	Basics of Deploying Application on Heroku.
3.	New Python framework Flask.
4.	Used Bootstrap for the first time Properly.
